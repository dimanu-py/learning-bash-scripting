# Learning bash scripting

## Description

This repository will contain some basic scripts example while I learn how to create bash scripts to automate different commands and workflows that could be executed through a terminal emulator.

## Set up

When we create the _.sh_ file, we won't have execution permission. We can run the scripts by using the following command `bash <file_name>` or `sh <file_name>`.

If we want to run the script by using `./<file_name>` we need to grant execution permission to the file.

To grant execution permission to our user run `chmod u+x <file_name>`
